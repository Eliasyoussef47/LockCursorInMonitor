# LockCursorInMonitor
Allows the user to confine the cursor to the monitor it's on when they hold the ctrl key.

I made this because I like to quickly grab a window and slide it to the edge of the screen to make it take half of it. This becomes challenging when you have multiple monitors and you want to quickly dock a winow on a side of a screen that's between two monitors because your cursoR will cross over to the other monitor.

That's why I made this. Now when I press and hold the ctrl key the cursor can't get out of the monitor it currently on. This app that I spent too much time on completly solves the minor inconvenience I described above this.
